# Expense-Tracker üöÄüöÄ
An application made with the ionic framework, whose objective is to help control our expenses and improve the individual economy of each person. 
The application will try to be in a near future a multiplatform application, that works in android, ios and in web version.

## How to compile it?
Just go to the web https://expense-tracker-39c01.web.app/ and that it's! 

This is just a beta version in a web form, in order to check how the application will work on mobile phones. The development process for android or ios has not started, 
although it is true that the transfer from web version to android or ios should not be very complicated thanks to the ionic framework

__Warning:__ *The app is not responsive design yet, so desktop users will have an ugly view of the app. For a better view go to the config of your browser and select the developer options
(in Chrome pressing Ctrl+Shift+I) and select your favourite device.*

## Where the data is stored?
At the moment the data is stored in the creator's personal firebase account, Enriqueloz88. This information is not subject to any type of encryption so storing compromising data is not recommended yet. 
If appropriate, the transfer to another database will be studied.

__Warning:__ *Please bear in mind that the free version of the database only supports 50,000 readings per day, so make responsible use of the application until it is optimized for its actual release on the market.*

## For developersüíª
You will have to install ionic in version 5. To check how to install just refer to https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli. You will also have to add the firebase library for the 
database storage and the chartjs library to see correctly the graphs in the app. In order to do that just type in your console:

> npm install chart.js --save

> npm install firebase @angular/fire --save

Make sure that you are in the correct directory when you do that. To compile your project just type *ionic serve* in your console in the root directory.

## Need help ‚ùì
Feel free to contact the developer if you have any questions or suggestions about the project or how you can help with it. It is a very simple project made with Ionic, 
therefore it is very useful if you want to start in the world of application programming.
